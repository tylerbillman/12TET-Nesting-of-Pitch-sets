# 12TET-Nesting-of-Pitch-sets
Code to organize the complete set of 12-TET pitch-sets/combinations into nested tiers: shows which sets of 1 pitch are in sets of 2 pitches, what sets of 2 are in 3, etc. Precursor code to display in browser/app as a unified field, preferably as an extremely advanced cousin to the classic "circle of fifths."
